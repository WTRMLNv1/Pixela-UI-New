# Pixela 🖌️

**Pixela** is a desktop application built with **Python** and **CustomTkinter** that allows users to **track habits, create graphs, and visualize their productivity** in a sleek, interactive interface. Perfect for anyone who loves data, visuals, or just wants to see their progress over time!  
This project is built on the [Pixela API](https://pixe.la), a habit-tracking API that allows users to manage graphs, add pixels, and visualise progress. Pixela provides a full GUI, allowing users to perform all of this without writing the code typically required by the API.
